# iGEE and iHVI summary

## Background
Mapping and analysing land surface temperature and landcover changes helps us to understand the relationship between urbanisation and the urban heat island effect. There is an increasing demand in heat vulnerability assessment to identify areas that are vulnerable to heat waves, and takes into account the location of vulnerable members of the community, such as the elderly, very young and those with lower capacity to adapt to heat. Thus RMIT AURIN High Impact Project aimed to establish a first nationwide dynamic and interactive heat vulnerability assessment toolkit. The toolkits integrated multiple data sources, cloud computing, and Web GIS technologies to deliver cool intelligence for more heat resilient Australian cities and suburbs. 

## Project aim
RMIT AURIN High Impact Project “Integrated Heat Vulnerability Assessment Toolkit for Australian Cities” (iHVI) aims to establish a first nation-wide, dynamic and interactive heat vulnerability assessment toolkit with enhanced workflow, automated analysis and modelling tools, so the indicators and indices can be updated and constructed by the users to serve more applications. 

## Project objectives   

1. Develop tools to derive land surface temperature (LST) and classify landcover types (NDBI and NDVI) via Google Earth Engine (GEE) API. 

2. Develop tools to construct heat sensitivity, heat adaptive capability indicators and composite heat vulnerability index.  

3. Enable modeling of the relationships between heat, environmental and social-economic factors.
